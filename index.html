    <h3> Where we began...</h3>
    <p>Beginning in a small village in Italy, Valentina was the yougest child of a well known chef who moved to the United States during war time. Here, he and his daughter would serve food to the troops coming home. Their favorite item? The Pizza! Now, Valentina Pizza operates over 50 restaurants in the United States and Mexico. And while many things have changed, one thing will always remain the sameâ€”the quality and care that goes into making each and every one of our legendary pizzas. And for that, we can all be thankful.</p>
